# Dataset Description for Life Expectancy Prediction

## **Source**
The dataset for this project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who). It originates from two primary sources:
- **World Health Organization (WHO):** Health-related data from 193 countries.
- **United Nations (UN):** Economic indicators corresponding to these countries.

This dataset offers a detailed overview of the health, socio-economic, and environmental factors impacting global life expectancy.
